Algorithm Analysis
An algorithm analysis is a technique that's used to measure the performance of the algorithms. Speed is one of the key parameters in determining the potential of an algorithm. There are some other factors, like user-friendliness, security, maintainability, and usage space, that determine the quality of an algorithm. Space and time complexity are metrics used to measure parameters.
